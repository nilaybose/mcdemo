    # Kibana is served by a back end server. This setting specifies the port to use.
    #server.port: 5601

    # Specifies the address to which the Kibana server will bind. IP addresses and host names are both valid values.

    # Enables you to specify a path to mount Kibana at if you are running behind a proxy.
    # Use the `server.rewriteBasePath` setting to tell Kibana if it should remove the basePath
    # from requests it receives, and to prevent a deprecation warning at startup.
    # This setting cannot end in a slash.
    #server.basePath: ""

    # Specifies whether Kibana should rewrite requests that are prefixed with
    # `server.basePath` or require that they are rewritten by your reverse proxy.
    # This setting was effectively always `false` before Kibana 6.3 and will
    # default to `true` starting in Kibana 7.0.
